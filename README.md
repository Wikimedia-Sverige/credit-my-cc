credit-my-cc
============

## Description
Credit-my-cc is a simple webpage (in Swedish) for producing a complaint when your images on Wikimedia Commons are improperly reused.

## How to use
1. Add the filename of the image on Wikimedia Commons and press **Kolla!**.
2. Add the URL where the image has been improperly used in the field **Anv√§ndning**.
3. If you want to be attributed in another way than what the tool could figure out from the data on Wikimedia Commons, edit the field **Erk√§nnande**.
4. The four radio buttons in the bottom are used to set the tone of the language in the template that is generated on a scale from ‚ò∫Ô∏è to üêµ.
5. Press **Skriv!** to generate the template.
6. Copy the text into your email client and send.

Hopefully you will get a proper response. Good luck!

## Requires
This requires [jquery.loadTemplate-1.4.5.min.js](https://github.com/codepb/jquery-template).

## Contributing
We would love to see more form letters, nicer design and perhaps most of all: ability to add more languages (for both the interface and form letters).
