<p>To whoever it may concern,</p>

<p>I noticed that you are using my image from Wikimedia Commons<span data-content="descr"></span> on the following page: <br />
    <span class="indent" data-content="usage"></span>
</p>

<p>My original is available<span data-content="upload_date"></span> at the following page: <br />
    <span class="indent" data-content="file_url"></span>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately it looks like you have not respected my copyright, even though I generously licensed the image under a Creative Commons license.</p>

<p>What you need to do is to:
    <ul>
    <li>Mention that I made the image: <span class="cmt" data-content="credit"></span></li>
    <li>Mention under what license the image is available under: <span class="cmt" data-content="license_title"></span></li>
    <li>Link to the licence text: <span class="cmt" data-content="license_url"></span></li>
    <li>State the image title: <span class="cmt" data-content="file_title"></span></li>
    <li>Link to where you got the image: <span class="cmt" data-content="file_url"></span></li>
    <li>If you made changes to the image you should mention that as well.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Here are some examples on how you can do that:
    <ul>
    <label>Online:</label> <span data-content="example_online"></span></li>
    <label>In print:</label> <span data-content="example_offline"></span></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>If these conditions are not met, the license is not applicable for your usage.
Your use of the image is thus an infringement of copyrighted material
for which compensation can be claimed in accordense to the Copyright Act.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
